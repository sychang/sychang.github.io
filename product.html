					<div id="solar-title-description">Currently, many impoverished rural Filipino families burn expensive and harmful kerosene to supply light from dusk to dawn.  Our challenge?  Design an affordable, sustainable, and user friendly communal light fixture using alternative energy sources. </div>
					<div id="solar-my-role-title">My Role</div>
					<div id="solar-my-role">With my team, I conducted user research and obtained information regarding rural Filipino lifestyle.  I was responsible for many of our design ideas early on during brainstorming, suggested the extendable feature of our light, and built the mid-fidelity prototype of our eventual design.  I created the graphics for our final showcase presentation. </div>

					<div id="solar-product-title">The Product</div>
					<div id="solar-product-description">Our resulting product concept, KIN, is a multi-functional, communal, and portable solar-powered light fixture.  Each individual light begins as a collapsed, upright lamp that can be used for studying or local tasks such as weaving crafts.  The light may be inverted, expanded, and hung from the ceiling as a communal room fixture.  If a family has multiple lights, they may be stretched, strung together, and mounted on a wall to serve as a decorative but functional fixture.  The solar panel lies on the outer side of the base, and the light can be easily charged by hanging it outside on a clothesline, for example.  From our research, we concluded that a cell phone charger is very important for citizens in our target community, so we designed a built-in USB port at the base of the light that can charge a connected cell phone. </div>

				<div id="solar-identify-need-text">Here is where we state the problem, rural communities burn kerosene which is harmful to their bodies and costly.  We want to change that.</div>
				<div id="solar-research-title">Research</div>
				<div id="solar-research-text">We conducted many interviews and talked to a lot of people so we could become more culturally aware.  In addition to the cultural side of research we did technical research into the cost of materials, and weighed the pros and cons of different alternative energy sources, from water to body heat before finally deciding on solar.  And here we have some more enlightening information on our research.  Woohoo!</div>
				<div id="solar-brainstorming-title">Brainstorming + Ideation</div>
				<div id="solar-brainstorming-text">We followed the divergence model with our ideation, eliminating all constraints and throwing out the most ridiculous ideas we could think of.  Blah blah from there we narrowed stuff down until we decided on features that were essential to our design blah</div>
				<div id="solar-prototyping-title">Prototyping</div>
				<div id="solar-prototyping-text">We went into the Innovation Lab and cranked out lots of low-fi designs to determine what was reasonable or not.  Oh here we can have lots of pictures in a griddish format of how we prototyped.</div>
