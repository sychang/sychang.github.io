<div id="ci-description">For three years in high school, I was a member of "Central Intelligence (CI)," our school's bi-weekly, student-produced television news program.  The shows we created aired to both our school as well as the local community.  Every year, I was a reporter and videographer, setting up interviews, filming b-roll, and editing the stories together using Final Cut Pro.  During my second, year, I was the school's lead Memories Video producer, and I was in charge of planning, filming, and editing an hour-long video for the student body to commemorate our school year.  In the last year, I was the line editor for the news program.  In addition to producing my own stories, my responsibilities included collecting and quality checking the staff's stories, inserting graphics, audio, and anchor segments between the stories, and editing together the overall news show.  CI taught me how to collaborate with peers and strangers, how to put my best work forward under tight deadlines, and how to ask questions that really matter.  Below are some samples of the stories I created: </div>
