<div id="gradient-container">
	 <div id="gradient-summary">Today, over 3 out of every 5 Americans own a smart phone.  In our team's cursory survey, 64% of smart phone users reported that their phone reached a low battery zone "Almost Everyday."  That amounts to millions of people worried about not being near an outlet when they need their phones the most.  External chargers are useful, but they, too, need to be charged.  What if they didn't need to be?</div>

	 <div id="gradient-problem-header">The Problem</div>
	 <div id="gradient-problem">Cell phone charging is a big pain point for users all over the world.  20%...16%...4%...youth, college students, and adults, alike, have a keen awareness of their phone's battery draining.  Murphy's Law guarantees that a phone will run out of battery when it is needed the most - when trying to meet up with a friend, sending an urgent email, or on a hike in the middle of the woods.  Without an outlet nearby, there are few solutions to this power problem.</div>

	 <div id="gradient-proposal">Our Proposal</div>
	 <div id="gradient-proposal-text">My team of four Berkeley students aims to design and develop a user-friendly hand-powered device that supplies energy to a mobile unit or charger so users no longer need to rely on external energy sources.  The goal of this project is to make charging more convenient and reduce worldwide energy use from the routine recharging of devices.</div>
