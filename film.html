      </div>


      <div class="section-heading">Project Summary</div>
      <div class="section-text"><strong>Impact and opportunity: </strong>For three years in high school, I was a member of "Central Intelligence (CI)," our school's bi-weekly, student-produced television news program. The shows we created aired to both our school as well as the local community.  For a semester, I was also in CalTV, Berkeley's online television station.</p>

      <p><strong>My role: </strong>For each year of CI, I was a reporter and videographer throughout the year. During my second, year, I was the school's lead Memories Video producer, and I was in charge of planning, filming, and editing an hour-long video for the student body to commemorate our school year. In my third year, I was the line editor for the news program. In addition to producing my own bi-weekly stories, I collected and quality checked the rest of the staff's stories.  I inserted graphics and anchor segments between the stories to put together the whole news show. </p></div>

      <div class="section-heading">"Central Intelligence"</div>
      <div class="section-text"><p><strong>Creating A Show: </strong>
        For CI, my partner and I would pitch a story topic at the start of every month, set up interviews around the school and community, film the interviews, then write a voiceover script based on those interview sound bites, film appropriate video clips, or b-roll, to lay over the audio, then edit the pieces together in Final Cut Pro.  Below is an example of one of our news stories, investigating <strong>"Girls On The Run,"</strong> an after-school program that teaches elementary schoolers the importance of physical and mental health.</p>

      <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.schooltube.com/embed/f439175c9fcd4a689c62" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

      <p>Another type of story is the feature story/documentary that details our subjects on a more personal level.  This one is about <strong>"Coping With Cancer,"</strong> looks into the lives of two students at our school who lost their parents to cancer.</p>

      <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.schooltube.com/embed/26c944505b768c0c57cf" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

      <p>A final feature story details <strong>"The Greatest Generation,"</strong> a group of WWII veterans who are making a difference in the classroom.</p>

      <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.schooltube.com/embed/6edac1d5ec2fae9f4529" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>


      <p><strong>Montage Editing: </strong>At the end of every school year, CI creates an hour-long "Memories Video" to commemorate the year's events. As part of its production, I was in charge of editing a montage documenting our entire student body. My team and I filmed over 4 hours of video footage to capture the <strong>"Faces"</strong> of our student body. After filming, I cut the song mix and edited the clips together in a fast-paced and creative manner - these took over 50 hours of work each, but was probably my favorite part of CI.  Below are the "Faces" montages from two years' Memories Videos.</p>

       <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.schooltube.com/embed/44544bcc91e441899ffd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

        <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvj9Rl3AQzs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p><strong>Short Film: </strong>As a capstone project for the International Baccalaureate Film program, I collaborated with a director, cinematographer, and script writer to produce a seven-minute short film as our capstone project.  The <strong>film trailer</strong> for our short film is below.</p>

        <div class="video"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-9v019ZS68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

        <p>The full film, <strong>"A Second Chance,"</strong> is below.  It tells the tale of how mere seconds and one seemingly insignificant event, like spilling a glass of water, can mark the difference between something as dramatic as life and death.  It answers the question that is constantly on our minds: "What if?"</p>

      <div class="section-heading">Challenges and Things I Learned</div>
      <div class="section-text">
          <p><strong>Working with best friends and strangers: </strong>Through this program, I learned to understand strangers quickly, whether I was working with them or interviewing them.  On the flipside, some of my most challenging teamwork experiences came when I was working with close friends.  This program taught me how to be considerate, but assertive of my ideas, in order to produce our best work the most efficiently.</p>
          <p><strong>Deadlines: </strong>Throughout the school year, we had bi-weekly deadlines, and I learned to appreciate deadlines and work efficiently under pressure.  I learned how to creatively simplify tasks without sacrificing work level. </p>
          <p><strong>Attention to detail: </strong>I hate putting in half-effort for projects, and I gained a strong attention to detail by constantly editing.  If a pause between interview sound bites was a split second too long or the camera was  tilted during a shoot, it noticeably interrupted the rhythm of the story, so I paid great attention to detail when editing.</p>
          <p><strong>Asking questions that really matter: </strong>I believe broadcast journalism has a strong connection to design, because in both fields, there is storytelling involved - whether it's to convey a design or report about someone's experience.  I learned that asking the right questions helped understand interviewees better return a much more meaningful narrative. </p>
