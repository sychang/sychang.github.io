	 <div id="flare-summary">The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) challenged our team of five Berkeley students to develop a mobile app to address a social problem.  Our focus area: Natural disasters and emergencies.</div>

	 <div id="flare-problem">The Problem</div>
	 <div id="flare-problem-text">Every year, 10,000 deaths and injuries result from natural disasters in the United States, alone. 25% of those deaths would have been preventable with faster, more directed search and rescue efforts. Our task? Lower the 25% to zero.</div>

	 <div id="flare-role">My Role</div>

	 <div id="flare-role-text">I served as project lead, maintaining mentor contact, interviewing target users to refine our app content, and designing the front-end user interface for our app.</div>

	 <div id="flare-our-app">Our App Concept</div>
	 <div id="flare-our-app-text">Flare automatically sends a user's location to first responders in the event of a natural disaster and enables users to manually designate the scale and severity of the emergency.  The purpose is to help coordinate disaster rescue efforts and allow responders to better allocate their resources and teams. In tracking inclement weather, the app will notify users of weather alerts within a designated radius of their current location or a saved location and provide a disaster manual detailing the steps to take before, during, and after the top eight most prevalent natural disasters in the world.</div>

	 <div id="flare-design-process">Interaction and Interface Design Process</div>
	 <div id="flare-identify">Identifying the Need: If a natural disaster strikes a city, how will emergency responders know where to look first?  How will the injured alert responders quickly if they are unable to move?  We wanted to create an app that provides a one-stop resource for responders and victims, alike, to increase efficiency as well as the number of lives saved.</div>
	 <div id="flare-research">Ethnographic Research: None of our team members had been in a natural disaster, so we needed to conduct user research to understand the situation and deduce user needs during a natural disaster.  For example, I interviewed the lead emergency responder from a Bay Area police department.  From this, I gathered data on current response protocol.  Researching established emergency resources, such as FEMA, I was able to aggregate content for our response manual. </div>
	 <div id="flare-design">Design and Execution: The goal for our interaction design on the user end was to keep the app as simple, concise, and functional as possible.  We first determined the three main functionalities for our app - recording location, providing weather alert details, and supplying a disaster manual.  Following our goal of straightforward quick navigation, we designed tabs to always display those three branches of information.  As a result, every app screen is accessible in three clicks or fewer.  After pinging a location, the user can use sliding scales to indicate the number of people in the immediate area as well as the severity of the situation. That information would be consolidated by our server and presented to ERTs as a map with markers of variable size and color based on the severity and scale of emergency. This way, they can quickly visually determine the areas with the greatest concentration of severe emergency and delegate their resources and teams appropriately.  Below are screen grabs during a preliminary round of design iteration.</div>
